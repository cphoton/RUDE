# BOM

For an upgrade from RUDE v1.0 to v1.1 the only hardware changes are the six ⌀5mm rods which have been replaced by just two 350 ⌀5mm steel rods and the 2x M5x40 steering bolts have been replaced by 2x M5x30.

If you come from Robak, you need HSP 102011 and 2x350 ⌀5mm steel rods and additional SHCS M3 + hex-nuts and 2x M5x30 bolts + square nuts.

This car can handle more power than Robak and is also heavier, I don't advise anything below 3S.
However be careful with 4S and higher since the HSP differentials were not designed with such powerful cars in mind. A precisely printed diffcase with a quality diff from the supplier I recommend below are key. Buy spares.

## Filament

98A / 60+D TPU from anywhere. Azurefilm 98A TPU is good. On Amazon there is 64D TPU from kexcelled alternatively there is 72D TPU from extrudr.
Not very useful for RUDE, but I use this super cheap quality filament for everything else (gridfinity etc.): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_olmRVrv

Part | Name | QTY | Notes

ESC + motor | 36xx or 42xx up to 82mm length | 1 | F.e. 3660 = 36mm diameter & 60mm length, 4278 = 42mm diameter & 78mm length.
ESC + motor | Hobbywing Ezrun MAX10 3665SD G3 2400KV + G2 140A ESC | 1 | Recommended. The newest Ezrun MAX10 sensored series is great. Get your Hobbywing electronics at a local shop, because aliexpress doesn't do warranty!
Battery for 4S combo [max 139mm x 47mm] hardcase preferred | 3S/4S 6200mAh | 1 | 3S: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EJYJMRf 4S: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oDYiMl3 or 9400mAh big battery: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mN7RnQx

RX + TX | DumboRC DDF-350 | X10FG or X6DCG | screen, lights/indicators support and with gyro https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oCQUDqW (select M2 for metal steering wheel)
Servo | DS3240-180 or any other 180 deg variant | 1 | https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnBFawT
1:8 Motor | Ysido 4274 | 1 | Cheap but overpowered https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmBblkx NOTE: you need a 1:8 ESC for this. [has 6.5mm banana plugs instead of 4mm]
1:8 ESC | Hobbywing Quicrun 8BL150 | 1 | I use this in combination with the Ysido. Get your Hobbywing electronics at a local shop, because aliexpress doesn't do warranty!

NOTE: 1:8 motors are at least twice as powerful as 1:10 motors and too much for RUDE which is a 1:10 truggy. One user tried the Ezrun MAX8 Sensored series and it kept somersaulting with just 4S with acceleration and throttle limited. Too much power causes the metal HSP parts to fail. I personally use the Ysido 2200 kV on 4S without issues, but make sure to limit throttle on tranmsitter and acceleration in ESC (this also goes for 1:10 MAX10).

wheels | HSP 88005 | 4 | I recommend cheap plastic rims https://aliexpress.com/item/4000537437419.html . They break but are cheap to replace. There's also metal ones https://aliexpress.com/item/4000537479774.html they don't break but will transfer impacts to CVDs which then wobble, hence I recommend the 'weak' plastic rims. There also are fitting Traxxas wheels TRX6792 that are made of stronger plastic and tires are already glued to rim.
shocks |INJORA Aluminum Shock Absorber 100mm | 4 | https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EQmCy8T comes with two springs per shock, use them all, intertwined
battery straps |20mm width; 200mm long |2 |max width 25mm
DIY hinge pins |⌀5mm steel rod | 2x350mm | https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_opSq9ew buying 500mm rods is best value (v1.0 needs 2x190mm + 4x66mm ⌀5mm steel rods)
silicone oil (front & rear shocks) | 2000 cSt | 20ml | this car's mass is >3kg so heavier oils preferred https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooUaPnU (very cheap)
silicone oil (diffs) |80.000 cSt | 20ml |50.000-100.000 cSt will work https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mKMass6 (from local shop is likely cheaper)
thread-locking fluid | | 10ml | Medium strength blue (cheap option: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mtYoqXC )
lithium grease | | 50ml |or any other grease for gears
CA glue / ZAP-RT | power glue | 20ml |tire glue (ZAP-RT for metal rims)
