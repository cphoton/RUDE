# Non-DIY option

## Introduction

Currently 2 options are supported:

- Traxxas 10760
- Traxxas 6878 with 50T spur gear. This is actually a slipper clutch, not a center differential. This is a cheaper option vs the center differential, but requires more frequent tuning.

Note that with either of these options, the spur gears are mod 0.8, not 0.6. You will need to switch pinion gears accordingly.

It should be possible to use adjustable shafts for both front and rear axles, however using adjustable shafts in the rear axle will impact the minimum teeth

### 1. Center diff installation

Instructions here will be the same for slipper clutch, instructions for the center differential are as follows:

1. Install center diff / slipper clutch on motor plate (using bearing).
2. Place another bearing on the center diff plate, place center diff in the middle.
3. Install the above subassembly on chassis. Tuning note: Center diff should spin without binding but not loose, i.e. similar rotation as with rear/front diffs. Use shims as needed.
4. Install motor on motor plate, do the gear mesh at this time.

### 2. Tuning steps

1. At this time, give the motor a spin for ~10-15 seconds. Everything should roll smoothly, if anything binds or diff gets hot, stop and check diff rolls smoothly without the motor.
2. Set up the rear diff part of the car as you would the front one, i.e. using the shorter 02030.
3. Assemble the rest of the car using normal procedure, repeating motor test after finished installing front and rear diffs.
4. If using slipper clutch, you will need to properly adjust it depending on your driving session (looser for grass, tighter for on road), as well as periodically (slipper clutch has pads that are expected to wear out over time)
