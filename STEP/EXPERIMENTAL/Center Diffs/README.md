# Center Differential

# Introduction

There are 3 options for center differential support:

* (cheapest) DIY solution based on the HSP 02024 differential, replacing the crown differential with the standard spur gear, with a 3D printable gear mount.
* (most expensive) Traxxas 10760 (or 10760X)
* (intermediate cost) Traxxas 6878. Note that this is a slipper clutch, not a center differential.

# Expectations

1. Note that with a center diff the driving experience changes a bit - in particular there is the possibility of overpowering the diff if applying full throttle from stand still (which can also be problematic on a non-center diff configuration as it stresses the drivetrain). Tinkering with oil viscosity may allow for different driving styles. For bashing, 500K-1M CST is recommended, but further testing is recommended.
2. A commercial diff will likely be more reliable than the DIY option but they tend to be significantly more expensive. Gear Mount being plastic will cause the seal effectiveness to vary depending on several factors. Over-diffing a lot may cause the diff to become very hot, which can cause the mount to degrade. Using a material with higher heat deflection is recommended.
3. Due to gear clearance, battery is supposed to be placed vertically, which limits the maximum capacity.

# Future developments

- Potential alternatives may be considered (particularly a CNC version for the gear mount) to further improve reliability.
- Additional options for center differentials would be considered. However, there are a few factors that limit possibilities. Limiting factors:
* 42mm is the current maximum for gear diameter. Bigger gears run the risk of sitting too close to the battery.
* Moving the axle center can cause clearance problems with the servo mount.
